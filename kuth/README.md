Kuth contains the scripts for Kubernetes under the Hood.
See https://github.com/mvallim/kubernetes-under-the-hood.

The scripts will make it easy to test and validate.

Different from the original repo, some improvements:
- Use GPT partition, not MBR partition
- Partition is more sophisticated, and good for production.
- Image is the latest.
- Kubernete is the latest.
- Some component is modern
